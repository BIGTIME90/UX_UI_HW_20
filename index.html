                We started by creating proto personas for the different types of users who would volunteer at Inside Books Project from a casual donator to the most dedicated who cared about the cause and was invested in supporting in numerous ways. After identifying who our users were, we shifted our focus to the usability of the current IBP webpage by performing a heuristic evaluation. We uncovered that the site did not illustrate a clear identity: who IBP is and what they do. 
                </p>

                <p>To learn if what we hyposthesized were issues of real potential users, we conducted 8 semi-structured, virtual interviews. There was a consenus that the walls of text prevented people from having a delightful experience on the site and that there wasn’t clear path on how to support at a glance and the legitimacy of the site was questioned. There was definitely a need for the solution to be more transparent and have a better UI experience. </p>

                <p class= "lastP"> We conducted several competitive analyses to generate more ideas before finalizing our user persona which would inform our user insight. </p>

                Keeping our user at the forefront, we knew Marta was incredibly busy. She wants to use her time and expertise as effectively as possible with a legitimate organization that has a measurable impact.  We knew that to attract donors and volunteers, Inside Books Project needs a website that lends credibility to their work and gives users a clear path to get involved. </p>

               <p> With a strong understanding of our user’s needs and what we were trying to solve, we used the “I Like, I Wish, What If” method to lay out the ideas we were interested in bringing to life. This informed our feature prioritization map and direction on what we would redesign. To solve our problem of illustrating the organizations legitimacy and showcasing measurable impact, we wanted to have a clear mission statement, secure donation methods, standout CTA buttons and a design that not only had utility, but also some delight.

                Starting with a mobile-first design, we created a site map based on information we gathered from user tests and our feature prioritization matrix. We then created a style guide ensuring our colors and fonts were accessible and that our call-to-action buttons would stand out. Below are some wireframes and lo-fi & mid-fi protoypes:

                We took our prototypes to 8 more people and received feedback to humanize and personalize the page with more photos and quotes at the forefront. They also wanted easier naviagtion and more concise text. We addressed these in our final, hi-fi prototypes to the right. Users’ reactions to these were pleasant: they agreed that the site looks much more credible and that the UI is more appealing. However, our rich color palette got lost and there was too much black, especially in the CTA buttons. </p>

            <p>Our main takeaways were that we needed to stay grounded in realities of the organizations capabilties, continue with the use of vibrant and attractive colors and to use the same users for each round of usability testing. We would expect there to be more traffic to the site, more time spent on each page and an increase in engagement (all types of volunteers) for Inside Books Project with the enhancements.</p>
